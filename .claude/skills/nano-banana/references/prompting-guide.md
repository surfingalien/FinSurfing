## Text Rendering Tips

Nano Banana 2 excels at text. For best results:

### Do:

```
✓ "A neon sign reading 'OPEN 24 HOURS' in pink and blue"
✓ "Book cover with title 'THE LAST GARDEN' in elegant serif font"
✓ "Protest sign with handwritten text 'SAVE THE BEES'"
```

| `bold sans-serif` | Modern, impactful |
| `elegant serif` | Classic, sophisticated |
| `handwritten` | Personal, casual |
| `retro typography` | Vintage posters |
| `graffiti style` | Urban, street art |
| `gothic/blackletter` | Medieval, heavy metal |

### Avoid:

```
✗ Very long text passages (keep under 10 words)
✗ Multiple different text elements competing
✗ Tiny text that would be illegible
```

## Character Consistency

### Initial Character Definition

Be extremely specific on first generation:

```
"Portrait of a 30-year-old woman named Sarah:
- Auburn wavy hair, shoulder length
- Green eyes with gold flecks
- Light freckles across nose and cheeks
- Warm smile, slight dimples
- Wearing a cream cable-knit sweater
Photorealistic, soft natural lighting"
```

### Subsequent Scenes

Reference the original with `history:0`:

```
"Sarah from history:0, now in a different scene:
- Standing in a bookshop
- Browsing old leather-bound books
- Same outfit (cream sweater)
- Afternoon light through window
- Same photorealistic style"
```

### Consistency Tips

1. **Lock core features** - Always mention distinctive traits
2. **Vary only context** - Change setting, not character
3. **Maintain style** - Keep artistic approach consistent
4. **Use session history** - Reference previous generations

## Quality Enhancement Keywords

### Resolution & Detail

- `4K resolution` - High detail output
- `highly detailed` - Intricate elements
- `sharp focus` - Crisp subject
- `intricate details` - Fine textures/patterns

### Professional Quality

- `award-winning` - Competition-level quality
- `professional` - Polished, commercial
- `masterpiece` - Exceptional craftsmanship
- `trending on ArtStation` - Contemporary digital art style

### Negative Prompting

Tell the model what to avoid:

```
"Beautiful landscape, no people, no text, no watermarks,
no blurry elements, no oversaturation"
```

## Domain-Specific Prompts

## Troubleshooting Prompts
